As you know, a fractal is a pattern of infinite fractions. Something like
1 + (1/(2 + 1)/(2 + 1/(2 + ...)))

One way to think about a fractal as a shape is to think of a whole shape that
is made by parts that are exact copies of the whole shape. So theoretically,
fractals are infinite.

So naturally, to render fractal shapes, we use recursion.
