Episode 32, Line Intersections Part I

We will discuss how to determine where two 2-D lines intersect.

Any pair of non-parallel 2-D lines will eventually intersect. This is not true
of line segments.

We can of course define a line with "y = m * x + b" or with two points on the
line.

Recall that m = (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1).

A third way to represent a line is known as "standard form": Ax + By = C
A = X2 - X1, B = Y1 - Y2, C = A * X1 + B * Y1
However, in standard form, I believe A should be positive and maybe C has to be
1, but I'm less sure about the second part and also not totally sure of the
first part.

So if we have two lines:
1) A1 * x + B1 * y = C1
2) A2 * x + B2 * y = C2
And we know all of the constants, we can solve for (x, y), the intersection of
the two lines.

We can solve for x in (1):
3) x = (C1 - B1 * y) / A1

Then substitute (3) for x in (2) and solve for y:
4) y = (A1 * C2 - A2 * C1) / (A1 * B2 - A2 * B1)

Then substitute (4) for y in (1) and solve for x:
5) x = (B2 * C1 - B1 * C2) / (A1 * B2 - A2 * B1)

And we're done.
