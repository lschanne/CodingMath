This directory contains the examples from and my notes on a YouTube series
called Coding Math, which uses JavaScript to teach the math used in
programming.

Here is the link to the channel:

I also included the link to the first video in the Ep1-Introduction/notes.txt
file. I won't include anymore of the links, as they should be easily found
from these two.

I guess I don't expect to learn a great deal of actual math in this course, as
I would hope that my knowledge of math is greater than the basics needed for
programming. However, it will hopefully serve as a nice refresher on the
concepts as well as a good platform for learning JavaScript and even some
basic Html and CSS.
