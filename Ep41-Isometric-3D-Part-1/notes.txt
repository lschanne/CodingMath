Isometric 3D is sometimes described as "3D without perspective", which isn't
quite true. Isometric 3D lacks linear perspective, but you can't create any 3D
effective without some sort of perspective.

Isometric 3D is so named because all of the angles axes are equal. Although
even that isn't quite true. Usually we use 2:1 triangles to build the "blocks"
in Isometric 3D, which makes it really Diametric 3D, but people don't call it
by that name.

^ not really a great description; the visuals are kind of necessary, so watch
the video
