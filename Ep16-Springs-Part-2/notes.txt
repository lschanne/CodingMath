##### Part A #####
In reality, most springs have a certain length at which they come to rest.

In Ep15, we were working with an implicit assumption that that rest length
was zero.

In this episode, we will step it up a notch.

##### Part B #####
Now we will make two particles spring towards each other, so think of a single
spring connecting two weights.

We also had to add some edge handling to this script.

##### Part C #####
Now we'll make a little spring triangle. It'll be dope.

We'll also improve on the things done in Part B.
