In this video, the guy talks about cosine and tangent and relates them to sine.

Again, pretty basic math stuff.

I guess one interesting thing to remember is that at 90 degrees and -90
degrees, the tangent function approaches both infinity and negative infinity
depending on which side your approach from.

Again, we use the same index.html from Ep1. The basic setup of the main.js
script is similar as well.

In JavaScript, we use the sine function to move a circle on the screen.
