Continuing where we left off...

So one thing that would be nice is to selectively render certain sticks.
For example, the support beam running through the middle of a square might be
nice to hide.

We added some more styling to sticks and created a way to add forms composed
of multiple points.

Mr. Peters (Dr?, maybe) also discussed rendering an image in the space between
four points. For image rendering, the points should always form a rectangle
that is ideally the same aspect ratio as the rendered image. I skipped the
implementation of this segment in my own code because I didn't feel like
grabbing an image for it.

Although it is actually pretty interesting, and the video is good.
