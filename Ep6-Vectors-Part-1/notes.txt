Here we discuss the theory behind vectors.

Vectors encapsulate both magnitude and direction.

Typically a vector is represented with an arrow.

We can refer to a vector pointing from point A to point B as vector AB.
If point A is the origin, we may call it vector OB or simply vector B.
If point B is at x=7 and y=4, we can refer to the vector as <7, 4>.

We may of course add vectors. If we have vector A = <x0, y0> and
vector B = <x1, y1>, then we may say that vector
C = A + B = <x0 + x1, y0 + y1>.

It can be useful to define some vector A = <x, y> as the sum of two vectors,
Ax = <x, 0> and Ay = <0, y>. These three vectors together of course form a
right triangle. If we let M = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) represent the magnitude of A
and let theta be the angle between A and Ax, then we have x = M * cos(theta)
and y = M * sin(theta).

Vector subtraction is as easy as vector addition. Multiplication of vectors
doesn't really exist between vectors. We have the dot product and cross
product instead. We can of course multiply a vector by a scalar, which simply
changes the magnitude, not the direction. Although, if the scalar is negative,
that will reverse the direction, which could be considered a change in
direction, or not.
