Easing is really only great for moving an object into position. The starting
movement is not amazing.

Also, simple easing has an unpredictable time of arrival. Furthermore, it never
actually stops moving the object. For these reasons, simple easing is really
only good for one-off animations.

For coreographing multiple objects or anything more complex, you will want to
explore some more advanced tweening.

Some guy named Robert Penner wrote the JavaScript tweening a while ago and
stuck that ish in the Math library. We will copy his work, but not stick it
in Math.
