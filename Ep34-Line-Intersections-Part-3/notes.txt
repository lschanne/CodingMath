In this episode, we'll look at applications for our intersection functions
from the previous two episodes.

Collision detection is a good candidate for line segment intersection detection
when using irregular shapes (like a star).

He also talked about how you could use line segment intersection to detect
if a point would cross over a line on the next frame. I didn't include that
code, but it is an interesting application.
