"Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles,
and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line."
 - Benoit Mandelbrut, Fractal Geometry of Nature
^ that's the dude who coined the term "fractal"

A "fractal" is a form that has self-similarities on different scales. These
exist everywhere in nature. A tree is a good example, so we'll look at that.

Consider a "branch" to be a line that splits off into two lines at the halfway
point, each of those lines being branches themselves. This would form a very
simple tree.

We added some randomness to these simple trees to make them look (sometimes) a
bit more realistic. Although a lot of times they look like total chaos, which
is also nice.

I saved that first part as simple-fractal-trees.js

Then we looked at making Pythagorean trees, which is a little hard to explain
in writing. But if you were to draw a right triangle such that the hypotenuse
was on the "bottom" and parallel with the "ground", then you can draw three
perfect squares using the edges of the triangle as edges of the three different
squares. Then you would have a tree like object. You could continue the pattern
by using the squares that form the branches to construct two new right
triangles and draw two branch squares off of each of those. Repeat ad nauseum.

This will be in the main.js file.

To code this is a little tricky, but we will use some canvas transformations
to help simplify the math a bit.

And we added a bit of animation to to the Pythagorean trees.
