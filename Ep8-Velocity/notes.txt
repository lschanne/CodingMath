The index.html has been updated a bit from the one we've been using so far.
It is pointing to multiple scripts.

We also build on the vector.js script from Ep7.
We also added a new particle.js script to manage our "physical object".

When we define speed, typically we default to using pixels per frame. The
actual observed speed can vary quite a bit depending on the frames per second.
If the computer is slow or dealing with a heavy load, the frame animation rate
may decrease.

If the script is computationally intense, that may also decrease the frame rate
or even cause frames to be skipped.
