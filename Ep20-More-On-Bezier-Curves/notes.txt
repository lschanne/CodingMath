So we first looked at how to place a control point so that the curve passes
through another particular point.

The next part of the video touched on something you already explored - making
bezier curves with any number of control points. His approach is a bit
different. Instead of continuously interpolating until there is only one
point remaining, he takes the midpoint of each control point and then
just plots quadratic bezier curves between each midpoint. I'm not sure if those
curves end up being the same, so I'll overlay them on top of each other and
see what happens.

So these methods don't seem to yield the same results. I guess the guy in the
video never explicitly states that his method yields a true bezier curve. I
guess this is reassuring in the sense that I wasn't sure how to prove that
the results should be the same.

Ah yes, later in the video he explicitly states that his technique is in fact
not the same as a true bezier curve.
