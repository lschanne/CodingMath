From the last episode, we know now that tweening has a lot of overhead.
We need to store properties of the object to be tweened, start time, current
time, duration of the tween, etc.

We looked at some ways we could generalize the process and automate that
overhead a bit.

I guess the next step to take would be passing in multiple objects to be
tweened? Maybe even multiple durations for those different objects. However,
there is of course a trade-off. If you try to overgeneralize and accomodate
every possible scenario, you get code bloating and added complexity. Still,
I feel like passing in a list of objects, target properties, and durations
isn't too bad.
