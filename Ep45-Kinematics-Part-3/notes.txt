Now we'll do some inverse kinematics, where we select a position that we want
a particular segment to reach. Then we work backwards and figure out the
position of each other segment.

We will create a new Arm object that is similar to the one we used for
forward kinematics.

We will also create an iksystem that is similar to the fksystem.
