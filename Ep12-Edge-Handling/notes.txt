In this episode, we discuss strategies for handling what should happen when an
object reaches and/or passes the edge of the screen.

In Ep-10, we used a very simple screen wrapping technique.

Our techniques will involve utilizing the radius of the particle, so we have
added that attribute to our particle object.

We need to refine the screen wrapping so that the particle moving on and off
screen is more gradual.

Another strategy is to simply remove a particle when it moves off the screen
to avoid wasting computation and rendering on obsolete objects.

The next strategy is known as "regeneration". When an object goes off screen,
it is recycled and placed at some emitter point to be reused.

The last strategy we will cover is bouncing. When a particle hits the edge of
the screen, it will "bounce" off of it.
We use an approximation for our reflection rather than using some snell's law.
