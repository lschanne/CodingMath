Continuing where we left off...

We will look at pinning points, which allows for static objects that other
points and sticks can pivot on, swing on, rotate around, etc.
(This part is saved as pinned_chain.js)

Then we looked at adding some moving parts to the system.

The rest of the video then looked at abstracting the code a bit and using JSON
files to load in the desired points, sticks, etc.

I didn't do this part of the code, because it included a lot of mindless work,
and the actual concept was not too complicated. While not complicated, the
concept is definitely good to keep in mind.
