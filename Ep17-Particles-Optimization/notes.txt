So this time around, we'll look at ways to optimize the particle object that
we've been using pretty heavily.

One thing we'll be doing is improving usability by allowing for a call to
particle.x rather than particle.position.getX(), for example.

So, yes, we will be pretty much abandoning the integration of the vector object
into the particle object.

With these updates, the particle object is much easier to interact with.

Some people might take issue with the removal of the getter and setter
functions. Now we just interact directly with the attributes x, y, vx, and vy.
