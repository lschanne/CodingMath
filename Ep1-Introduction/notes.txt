All you need to run javascript is a text editor and a browser.

You need to setup and html file, typically just called index.html that points
to the javascript file.

So something that isn't covered in the video is adding character context
encoding to the html document. This may not be strictly necessary, but it is
something that I have added to my index.html here.
