Building on the last episode, we'll look at building predefined layouts, with
specific tiles/blocks in specific locations.

Usually you would want to keep the predefined layouts in a separate json file.
In this case, we'll skip that for simplicity.

These layouts can be totally static or programatically generated. I think even
if they are programatically generated, it could be a good idea to save a static
file of the generated layout to improve performance.

We created another canvas layer on which to draw dynamic objects on top of the
static isometric grid. The extra canvas layer has to be created in the HTML and
then identified in the JavaScript.

We used that layer to move around a "character" object on top of the
isometric 3D grid.

TODO: fix the drawCharacter() function.
^ yeah right, that's never getting done.
