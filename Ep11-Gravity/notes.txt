We talked about gravity and how it is relative to the size of mass and the
distance to the mass.

gravity = G * m / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant, m is the mass,
and r is the distance between the centers of the objects.

For programming purposes, you really don't need to know the value of G, you
just need the relationship of m/r^2.

To help with gravity, we added a mass property to the particle object.

We also added an angleTo method to determine the angle between two objects and
a distanceTo method to determine the distance between two objects. These two
methods will allow us to determine the proper gravity vectors.

We consolidated all of that into a gravitateTo method.

Using these methods, we were able to create a sun and a planet in orbit.
