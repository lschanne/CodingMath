We'll be stepping away from 3D concepts for a bit to discuss easing and
tweening, which both refer to the idea of moving an object from a given
position to another known position.

So we cover how to go from point A to point B visually. Points A and B can be
literal coordinate points or points of state (i.e. changing alpha values,
changing shapes, etc.).

The word "tweening" comes from early animations where you would have to hand
draw every frame. The best animators would draw the most important frames, and
then the rank-and-file animators would come in and draw the frames in between
those important frames, aka the "tween" frames. The term stuck.

Linear tweening is the most obvious and easiest to implement. However, it
doesn't really look great. Natural tweening should implement some acceleration
at the start and some decceleration at the end, which is referred to as
"easing" in and "easing" out.

Now we have the terms "tweening" and "easing" covered, as well as the basic
concepts. So easing is just a type of tweening that looks more realistic.
