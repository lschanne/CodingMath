Well this series might be a total waste of my time.

This video covered hypotenuse, adjacent, opposite, and sine.

If you ever forget, just remember SOH CAH TOA.

On most computer screens, the y-axis is actually flipped from the typical
cartesian coordinate system. The negative y-axis is at the top of the screen,
and the positive y-axis is at the bottom of the screen.

This flip also means that the measurement of angles on the screen goes
clockwise rather than counter-clockwise.

And of course, bear in mind that programming functions will take radians
rather than degrees.
    degrees = radians * 180 / pi
    radians = degrees * pi / 180

The index.html is pulled right from Ep1. I did remove the character encoding
just to see if it works without that. It is fine without the encoding, but the
console log still complains. I would just include explicit encoding, but maybe
I will learn more on that topic going forward.

We use JavaScript to print the sine values from theta = 0..2pi
and draw a sine wave.
