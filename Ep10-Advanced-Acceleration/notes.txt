We talked about dynamic forces with changing acceleration.

We used listen events for the arrow keys being pressed to adjust the
force acting on our particle.

So the "keydown" event represents a key being pressed. Each key pressed has
a key code. If you need to find out the key codes, you can use
`consose.log(event.keyCode);`

The key codes for left, up, right, and down arrows happen to be 37, 38, 39,
and 40, respectively.

We also added code to rotate our object so that it is always pointing in the
direction in which it is moving.

So by adding dynamic turning and thrusting as well as a screen wrap for our
particle, we basically have the very bare bones of the classic asteroid game.
