In programming, kinematics usually refers to forward and inverse kinematics.

We are typically interested in a set of segments that
are attached/connected somehow as a whole system.

In forward kinematics, we move the unit and see how that adjusts the
individual segment.

In reverse kinematics, we move a segment and see how that affects the rest
of the system.

When we move each part of the system using numbers with a common divisor,
the system moves in a repeated pattern or cycle.
On the other hand, if we use numbers that are not at all related, the motion
of the system can be somewhat random and unpredictable.
