Mathematically, we covered arccosine, arcsine, and arctangent.
These may also be referred to as inverse cosine, inverse sine, and
inverse arctangent.

Generally speaking, cosine and sine will be used much more often than
tangent, and arctangent will be used much more often than arccosine and
arcsine.

Arctangent tends to be quite useful in programming. Consider this situation:
You have an object on the screen at point (x0, y0) and the cursor is at
point (x1, y1). You know the cartesian distances between them:
x = x1 - x0 and y = y1 - y0. If you wanted to get the angle between the
cursor and the object, you can use the arctangent! theta = atan(y / a).
