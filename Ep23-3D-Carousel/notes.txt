Disclaimer: 3D Carousels suck; please don't use them professionally.

We will investigate how to create one here though in order to further explore
3D imaging.

We will of course be building on the 3D postcards in space.

One thing to consider that isn't obvious jsut from drawing a bunch of black
squares is that we need to draw objects further away first. That way, we don't
have to worry about objects in the background overlapping objects in the
foreground. We will handle that by implementing a zsort function.
