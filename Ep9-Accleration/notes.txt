We updated our particle object to include an acceleration.

Similar to velocity, acceleration is in units of pixels per frame per frame
by default. We can adjust our program to standardize velocity and acceleration
to be per second rather than per frame.

We also added a gravity component to our particle object. We looked at how to
set the default value to 0 by using an or ( "||" ), so that was interesting.
